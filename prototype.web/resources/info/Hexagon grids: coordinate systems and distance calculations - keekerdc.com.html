  <div class="entry-content"><p>A big challenge that loomed when I 
embarked on the Statecraft was proper implementation of a hexagon grid. 
 I felt the move to a hex grid was one of the few things that Civ V 
actually got right, and had the potential to bring a more interesting 
military layer to the game.  Unfortunately, it was done at the expense 
of…everything else.</p>

<p>Taking specific gameplay mechanics aside however, a poorly 
implemented hex grid, at the base technical level, has the potential to 
create massive headaches for me (the programmer) and millions of wasted 
CPU cycles.  The reason for this is the very nature of trying to assign 
Cartesian coordinates to a honeycomb grid.  Quite frankly, all the 
existing works browsable through Google searches on the subject of 
coordinate systems on hex grids are pretty piss poor, needlessly 
complex, or just flat out wrong; I would have to tackle the topic 
myself.</p>

<h4>First things first, square grids.</h4>

<p>Let’s step back a moment and consider a normal Cartesian plane, where the <em>x </em>axis is horizontal and the <em>y</em>
 axis is vertical; the graphing plane familiar to us all from our first 
algebra class onward.  If we lay down a square-based grid on top of this
 plane, calculating distances is a relatively easy task.  You can either
 go the old trusty Pythagorean route, using:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/pythagorean.png" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>…to get the distance ‘as the crow flies’, or you can calculate 
distances atomically, using indivisible units of movement ‘along the 
ground’ from one tile to another.  When considered from a board game 
context, we’re much more interested in the latter.</p>

<p>Civilization games before Civ V used a square grid to divide the play
 surface, and a move into any of the eight neighboring squares 
(vertical, horizontal, or along the diagonals) were all considered to 
take one unit of movement.  This was a rather strange way of calculating
 movement distances, as you could cover roughly 40% more territory by 
always making diagonal moves, rather than moving horizontally or 
vertically.  Consequently, calculating the distance between two squares 
‘along the ground’, assuming no obstacles, became relatively simple:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/distance-between-two-squares-along-ground.png" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>Since diagonal moves, where both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> change, 
still only count as one move, the smaller of the two ‘deltas’ becomes 
inconsequential; the number of moves it takes to go from one square to 
another will always be the largest of the changes in coordinates.</p>

<p>It’s easy to assign a consistent coordinate pattern to a square grid: start at (0,0); every square right adds one to the <em>x</em> coordinate, and every square upwards adds one to the <em>y</em>
 coordinate.  Things get a bit more complex when you try to do the same 
to a grid of hexagons, where there seemingly exists two plausible 
‘upwards’ axes.</p>

<h4>Some have taken the ‘squiggly’ y-axis approach to force a Cartesian feel into a hex grid.</h4>

<p>Let’s consider a small portion of a hex grid:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridLandscapeBase.png" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>The <em>x-axis</em> here is an easy one to assign.  You can start from any tile and go straight to the right, incrementing the value of <em>x</em> along the way.  But in which direction is the upward <em>y-axis</em>?</p>

<p>Some folks around the internets have decided to answer this question with a ‘squiggly’ <em>y-axis</em>, wherein you retain the same value for <em>x </em>first
 up and to the right, then up and to the left, then up and to the right 
again, and so on.  So a sample grid under this paradigm looks something 
like this:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridSquiggly.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>Doing so, however, creates a needlessly awkward problem when trying 
to determine an atomic distance ‘along the ground’ between two tiles in 
this grid, because any move from one row of tiles to another has to take
 into account whether you’re moving into a ‘left-handed’ column or a 
‘right-handed’ one – the change in the <em>x</em> coordinate is different for a move in any of these directions based on what kind of row you’re moving from.</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridSquigglyOddRow.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridSquigglyEvenRow.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>Thus, any formula you might try to put together to calculate atomic 
distances between two tiles, simply from their coordinates, has to take 
this strange ‘ripple’ effect you’ve introduced into the grid, since a 
movement in a particular direction can mean something different for the 
change in coordinates based on whether you’re in an even or odd row.  
This is not to say that it can’t be done, since it’s screwed up in a 
consistent manner, but it’s a complication that’s unnecessary.</p>

<h4>A better course is to straighten out the axes.</h4>

<p>In order to produce a consistent pattern to movement between tiles, 
and make this grid truly ‘flat’, we need to straighten out the axes.  We
 can do so by letting this <em>y-axis</em>, where x=0, lie along one of 
the diagonals, essentially shifting every row in the same direction.  I 
found it simplest to tilt it up and to the right, like this:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridStraight.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>This creates a consistent pattern for what a move from one tile to 
another means for your new coordinates.  A move directly right or left 
means a change in the <em>x</em> coordinate only.  A move along either of the diagonals will now <em>always</em>
 mean a consistent change in coordinates; this is an important thing to 
keep in mind as we try to find a reliable means of determining atomic 
distances between tiles.  The change in coordinates, from any tile, now 
looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridStraightChanges.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>Now we have a consistent ‘grain’ to our grid.  If you’re going ‘with the grain,’ either along the <em>x-</em> or <em>y-axes</em>, it means a change in that coordinate.  Going ‘against the grain’ means a change in <em>both</em>
 coordinates, in opposite directions.  Now, all we need is a formula, in
 which we can plug in two sets of coordinates and get back the distance 
‘along the ground’ between the two.  Once we have this, we’ve a solid 
foundation for solving other gameplay problems, such as pathfinding.</p>

<p>Problem is, a means of finding a consistent formula that produces the
 proper distance no matter which direction you’re moving in proves 
illusive; you can find a formula that works in two directions, but not 
the third.  What’s actually needed is a third axis.</p>

<h4>Hexes as three-dimensional cubes</h4>

<p>We get that third axis by adding…a third dimension.</p>

<p>Did anybody figure at the top of this discussion that Q*Bert had the answer all along?</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/s_Qbert_6.png" alt="Q*Bert!"></p>

<p>Check it.  Each cube actually forms a hexagon as rendered in two 
dimensions – from any given cube that Q*Bert is standing on, you have 6 
different one-step moves you can make.  If we fill in our missing third 
axis on the hex grid we’ve already been working with, so that you have 
three axes all offset by 120 degrees, an interesting mathematical 
phenomenon occurs.</p>

<p>Here’s our grid with the new <em>z-axis</em> plotted, in terms of the direction in which each coordinate slot increases:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridLandscapeTriDimension.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>This way, every hex will actually have three coordinates.  It’s less 
complicated than you might think, however, when we actually look at this
 section of grid we’ve been working with, with the <em>z </em>values 
plotted.  Have a look and see if you can pick out the interesting 
relationship that appears between the coordinate values within each 
tile:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/HexGridLandscapeTriCoordinates.gif" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>That’s right kids; the coordinates of any given tile add up to 0. <em>x + y + z = 0</em> no matter what direction in which you traverse the grid or how far you go.  Yes, that also means that the <em>z-axis </em>is
 technically a bit redundant in some situations, such as determining 
where to render each tile on the screen, however its advantage is clear 
when it comes to pathfinding and distance calculation.  Now, we have a 
consistent coordinate system in all directions on the grid – a truly 
flat system – and so we can arrive upon this formula for determining the
 distance between any two tiles, which should look pretty similar to a 
distance formula we examined earlier, in the context of Civ games:</p>

<p><img src="Hexagon%20grids:%20coordinate%20systems%20and%20distance%20calculations%20-%20keekerdc.com_files/cubic-hexagon-distance-formula.png" class="as-is block"></p>

<p>Just as in the example of the square grid, in which a move to any of 
the eight neighboring tiles counts as the same unit of movement; we 
arrive at a similar equation with a three-coordinate hex grid in which a
 move to any of the six neighboring tiles counts as the same unit of 
movement.  This is why a hex grid is preferable to a square grid when 
considered from the context of constraining movement to a grid – its the
 more accurate means of modeling movement that reaches further than one 
tile since there’s three axes to move along instead of two, and you can 
use it without bending Pythagoras completely out of shape.</p>

<h4>Applying it to gameplay</h4>

<p>Just some quick implementation notes (mostly for me, but maybe for you too):</p>

<p>Tiles can still be stored in the database with x and y coordinates 
only, as the z coordinate is redundant in terms of uniquely identifying 
tiles by coordinates, as well as in terms of positioning relative to 
each other on render.  I can figure out where to render a tile relative 
to (0,0,0) simply based on x and y.</p>

<p>The z coordinate can always be programatically generated since <em>x + y + z = 0</em>, so I’ll be writing code so that z is always generated on-demand when needed.</p>

<p>The orientation of the axes is relatively arbitrary.  The diagrams 
above could be easily flipped vertically, so that y increases downward 
and x increases up and to the right.  This would create a (0,0,0) tile 
in the upper left instead of the lower left.  Either way works, and 
doesn’t have any impact on the distance formula.</p>
